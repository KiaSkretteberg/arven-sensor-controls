# Arven Sensor Controls

- IDE: Microchip Studio
- Technology: C
- Hardware: Atmega328P 

This repo is for the code to run on the Arven robot and retrieve data from the following sensors:

- 2 IR Sensors -- drop detection for things steeper than stairs
- 3 Ultrasonic Sensors -- obstacle location infront/to the sides (~90 degrees, centered on the front)
- 2 Snap Action Switches -- used as "bump sensors" for detecting backing up into obstacles
- 1 Force Sensing Reistor -- used as a semi-accurate weight sensor for a medication bottle
